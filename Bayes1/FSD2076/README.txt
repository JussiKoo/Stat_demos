Opening a Data Guide:
Data guide (dgF) is in the FSDnnnn folder (e.g. FSD1000) and can be read using a web browser. The folders 'css', 'img' and 'js' contain html directory auxiliary files and do not need to be opened. Keep the existing folder structure so that the files work as intended.

--
Opening an SPSS Portable file:
Using SPSS, select in drop-down menu File -> Open -> Data, change the file type to SPSS Portable (*.por), select the file name and click on Open. NOTE! If Scandic characters ?,? and ? are not properly displayed (the problem occurs with SPSS 21 in particular): Choose from the drop-down menu Edit -> Options -> General -> Character encoding for data and syntax -> Local. Open the file as instructed above.

Html files of qualitative data:
Most qualitative datasets contain a html index which facilitates browsing the data and background information. For the index to work properly, first unzip the zipped file, carefully retaining the existing folder structure. Then start your browsing from the file index.html which contains the links to the actual data files.
